  <h1>Jeff & Will burger, The fun never stops!</h1>
    <p>Created By Jefferson And William</p>

 <p>Jeff & Will burger shop is all about keeping it authentic and fresh with a touch of modern food styles. Being keeping it aunthentic we are talking not having frozen patties in the back and having some cheap meat. We use the top-notch grade A burger meat alongside a master cook creating and cooking the best burgers around DC. we aren’t going hold back on how fat and unhealthy a burger is supposed to be made. But that doesn’t mean we are going to exclude those who love healthier choices, we also created the freshest salads along with the best vegan burgers you will ever taste.</p>

 <p>Our goal is to bring you the best burgers of all the DC area but not overpricing you as most restaurants do nowadays. We also want to create a more diverse menu that brings more burgers and different food choices from all around the world, along with enjoying these fantastic dishes in a friendly and very positive space.</p>
